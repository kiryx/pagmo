Parallel Global Multiobjective Optimizer (and its Python alter ego PyGMO) offers a
user-friendly access to a wide array of global and local optimization algorithms and problems.
The main purpose of the software is to provide a parallelization engine common to all algorithms
through the 'generalized island model'. Initially developed within the European Space Agency,
the code was intended to help the automated design of interplanetary trajectories and spacecraft
transfers in general. The user can implement his own problem and algorithm both in C++ and in Python.
