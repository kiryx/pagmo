    "PaGMO wraps one the Bayesian Optimization library, *bayesopt* [1].\n",

    "That's because headers are not copied correctly during build process. To fix this, either refer to the correct header files in the downloaded BayesOpt sources by setting the variable *BAYESOPT_INCLUDE_DIR*, or by manually copying the *bayesopt/include* to *usr/local*.\n",
